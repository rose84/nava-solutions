      <description>Customers using Nava Certus, may have noticed a few logistical complications with extremely large migrations. If a migration was large and the source files were still in used by users, then by the time you migrate the data there will be new versions of some files at the source.
In the past, we recommended to split up migrations into manageable chunks and to enforce a ‘freeze’ on the source during the migration.</description>

      <description>Google Drive Migration
Prior to releasing Nava Certus in June/July this year, we conducted a study of the cloud storage and data migration market in an effort to determine our pricing strategy. This was not an easy task since there weren’t (and still aren’t) that many commercially available tools for migrating data to cloud storage and specifically to Google Drive.
Still, we were able to get an understanding of the market and as a result set the introductory price to $4.</description>

      <description>If you are planning a Google Drive migration and require assurance that the files at the source are exactly the same as the files at the destination, then you may be interested in our “Migration Integrity” feature.
One of the features that we designed into Nava Certus from the very beginning is called Migration Integrity. While this feature is not the most visible to the user, it is perhaps one of the most important for our enterprise customers that may want to ensure a certain chain-of-custody within the migration process.</description>
