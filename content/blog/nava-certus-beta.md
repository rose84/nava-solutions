We are proud to announce the Beta release of [Nava Certus](/products/nava-certus), our powerful Google Drive migration software.

With this version of Nava Certus, you will be able to:

- Migrate files from a file server to a single Google Drive account for centralized sharing
- Migrate files based on file ownership (Distributed Migration) allowing you to distribute all your files and take advantage of up to 30GB built-in storage in Google Drive for each user.

You can download a trial version of Nava Certus directly from Linkgard. With the fully-functional trial version, you can migrate up to 1GB within 5 days for free. Afterwards, you    may purchase the product directly from within the software.

For migrations larger than 500GB, please contact us using the [Request a Quote](/request-a-quote) form and we will put you in touch with one of our partners who will be able to sell the software as well as provide migration services.

We are also announcing the opening of our Partnership program. If your organization would like to resell Nava Certus and provide associated migration services, you may wish to learn more about our [partnership opportunities](/about-us/partnership).
