We have been hard at work over the past months and we’re ready now to share our excitement. As of yesterday, we have released the Beta version of Nava Certus, our powerful migration software enabling you to migrate your [file server to Google Drive.](/products/nava-certus/)

In fact, the product is available as a fully functional trial that you can download for free (up to 1GB). We would love to hear your feedback.

With this release, we are able to deliver some cool features, such as:

  * Preservation of permissions
  * Recreation of folder hierarchy
  * Centralized migration (from single source to single user’s Google Drive)
  * Distributed migration (from single source to multiple users’ Google Drive)
  * Easy-to-use GUI
  * Support for scripting and advanced users

Nava Certus will be available for purchase directly from Linkgard’s website for migrations of 500GB or less.

If you are an MSP or Google Apps Service Provider, you may be interested to learn about the [Reseller program](/partners) from Nava Solutions.

So go ahead and give Nava Certus a try. We’d love your feedback.
