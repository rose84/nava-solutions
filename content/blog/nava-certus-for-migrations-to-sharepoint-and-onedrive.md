Nava Certus 1.6 is now available as a fully supported download. We now add support for SharePoint and OneDrive as migration targets. Also learn what Google has to say about Nava Certus in its blog post on Drive migrations.

The major focus for us in 1.6 has been to work towards completing the Sharepoint and OneDrive story. In our commitment to produce a universal cloud data migration solution, we’re happy to announce that version 1.6 of Nava Certus supports migration to Sharepoint and OneDrive.*

Nava Certus 1.6 is now officially supported and available for your download. As always, you get to migrate your first 1GB free of charge as part of a 5-day evaluation.

## Sharepoint and OneDrive migration

With Nava Certus now supporting migration to Sharepoint, customers now have a robust solution that they can utilize for many Sharepoint-related tasks, including:

- Migration to Sharepoint from a local file-server. Move all your data to Sharepoint (on-premise) or Sharepoint Online. Save both time and money by eliminating the need for a file server.
- Migration between two Sharepoint instances. If you have a new Sharepoint deployment and would like an easy way to migrate your data, then give Nava Certus a try.
- Office 365 migrations made easier. If your customer wishes to adopt Office 365, Nava Certus can help by migrating content to Microsoft OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive).
- Improve migration performance. Nava Certus’ multi-threaded and job-oriented design allows you to conduct multiple independent parallel migrations.
- Manage migration projects. Nava Certus’ reporting allows you to easily produce reports (final and progress reports) on the status of your migration.
- Many more sources/destinations. Check out the migration matrix below to see the full range of sources and destinations we support.
