The latest version (1.0.0.6) of [Nava Certus](/products/nava-certus/) is available for download starting today. With this release, we’re making minor but visible improvements to product functionality. Continue reading below for more info…

- Default User (Distributed): For distributed migrations, a new default user allows the migration of all un-mapped files to a single user. All files, whose owners are not found in the mapping file, will be migrated to the Google Drive account of the default user.
- Modification Time: Nava Certus now supports a “modification time” retention. Controlled by a configuration setting, this feature allows for migrated files to have the same modification time as the source file.
