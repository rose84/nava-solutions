Agility, speed and lower maintenance costs are always among the top migration drivers. Cloud computing enables you to spin up thousands of customized tailored servers in minutes whenever needed. Another advantage is that Instead of going through complicated and time consuming procurement process, you pay for the services and resources that you use on the go. Today cloud computing provides nearly everything from quantum computing, storage, and databases to continuous integration, data analytics, and artificial intelligence - at your fingertips. Such powerful resources enables you to tremendously reduce the timeframe for going from idea to implementation.

## Challanges in Migration to Cloud

While cloud computing services are easy to obtain, they become more valuable when necessary data is made available by uploading and making it accessible to the enormous cloud power. When migrating data to the cloud, there are various strategic decisions which needs to be considered and concerns to be addressed, including:

* Cloud infrastructure type, whether it should be private cloud, public or a hybrid one, or it should be multi cloud platform infrastructure.
* Strategy for migrating data from legacy on premise infrastructure and how to calculate the cost of migration.
* Risk of vendor lock-in as each cloud infrastructure provider has proprietary technologies.
* Availability risks, in case if a cloud vendor goes down
* Data privacy and security.
